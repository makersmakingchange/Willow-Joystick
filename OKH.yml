title: Willow Joystick
description: The Willow Joystick is a magnetic low force joystick. It builds off the work
  done on the LipSync to create a joystick that requires less force to use than
  any of the OpenAT joysticks in the MMC Library
intended-use: "The Willow is intended for users that find the existing joystick options in
  the MMC library too high force or require too large of a range of motion, and
  need a lower force, lower range of motion option. "
